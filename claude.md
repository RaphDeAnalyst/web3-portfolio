Please update the website’s design system to be strictly black & white (monochrome) with no accent colors, while ensuring accessibility and readability in both light and dark modes.

⚠️ Important: Do not leave any leftover accent colors. Replace all hardcoded classes, inline styles, and hidden defaults. If a component uses a Tailwind class like text-blue-500 or a library default color, replace it with the new grayscale tokens. This includes buttons, links, alerts, icons, hover states, and any third-party UI imports.

Steps to follow:

Update tailwind.config.js to define a monochrome palette under theme.extend.colors.

Search and replace all existing color classes in components (e.g., bg-blue-600, text-indigo-500, hover:text-sky-400) with the new tokens.

Check for inline style={{ color: ... }} or style={{ backgroundColor: ... }} and replace them.

Check third-party or hidden defaults (like shadcn/ui or system messages) and override them explicitly in your CSS or config.

Test responsiveness and accessibility in both light and dark mode to ensure proper contrast.

Output Required:

Updated tailwind.config.js.

Updated components (buttons, text, alerts, links, headers, footers, icons).

Confirmation that no non-grayscale color values remain anywhere in the project.

If any component resists the change, override it directly with Tailwind or custom CSS. Don’t skip. This is a global enforced monochrome redesign, not just a config update.

\*"Please update the website’s design system to be strictly black & white (monochrome) with no accent colors, while ensuring accessibility and readability in both light and dark modes.

### Requirements:

1. **Text Colors**

   * Light mode:

     * Primary: #000000
     * Secondary: #333333
     * Muted: #666666
   * Dark mode:

     * Primary: #FFFFFF
     * Secondary: #CCCCCC
     * Muted: #999999

2. **Button Colors**

   * Primary CTA Buttons:

     * Light mode: background #000000, hover #333333, text #FFFFFF
     * Dark mode: background #FFFFFF, hover #CCCCCC, text #000000
   * Secondary Buttons:

     * Light mode: border #000000, text #000000, hover background #F5F5F5
     * Dark mode: border #FFFFFF, text #FFFFFF, hover background #222222

3. **System Messages (Error/Success/Info)**

   * Keep in grayscale but with clear icons and typography for differentiation.
   * Example:

     * Success: checkmark icon + #111111 text
     * Error: cross icon + bold #000000 text with muted background
     * Info: info icon + #333333 text

4. **General Styling**

   * Remove all demo colors and accents.
   * Use weight (bold/regular), spacing, borders, and subtle shadows for hierarchy instead of color.
   * Ensure hover, focus, and active states are visible with grayscale transitions (opacity, underline, or subtle shadow).
   * Add smooth transitions for hover/focus states to avoid a “flat” look.

### Implementation:

* Update `tailwind.config.js` with a monochrome palette under `theme.extend.colors`.
* Refactor buttons, text, and message components to use these values instead of blue accents.
* Test responsiveness and accessibility in both light and dark modes to ensure proper contrast.

Output:

* Updated Tailwind config.
* Updated components with the black & white system.
* A summary of changes and where they were applied."\*

⚠️ Important: Do not only update the Tailwind config. You must also update every component that references old color classes, even if it means manually replacing them. Search the entire codebase for color values (hex codes, rgb values, Tailwind classes like blue-500) and replace them.

After changes, generate a summary list of all files updated and confirm that no non-grayscale colors remain in the codebase.
