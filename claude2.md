Prompt Suggestions for Claude Code

Here are example prompts you could send to Claude Code based on those observations, in case you want to instruct it to make specific improvements:

Prompt A: Improve card contrast & readability

Please review all cards (projects, blog, featured work) and make their background/text contrast stronger for readability. In light mode, ensure card backgrounds are slightly darker than page background and text is crisp (dark gray/black). In dark mode, lighten the card background a bit and use lighter text color. Do not change functionality. Apply this consistently across all card components.

Prompt B: Add interactive hover effects to cards + buttons

Add subtle hover effects for cards and buttons (e.g., slight shadow/enlargement/border change) to indicate interactivity. Use minimal effects to keep the clean design. Make sure effects work in both light and dark mode. Do not break layout or functionality.

Prompt C: Visual hierarchy & spacing refinement

Check section headers (“Featured Work”, “Latest Insights”, stats area) for spacing, font size, and weight. Increase separation and visual emphasis between sections where appropriate to guide the eye. Use consistent margins and spacing to create clean flow from one section to the next. Preserve responsiveness.

Prompt D: Footer distinct styling

Make the footer visually distinct: give it a slightly different background shade compared to main content, increase top padding, ensure footer links/text have enough contrast. Maintain minimal style.
