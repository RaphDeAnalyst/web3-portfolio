    tags: ["DeFi", "Analytics", "Python", "Dashboard", "Tutorial"],
    slug: "building-first-defi-analytics-dashboard", // Must be unique!
    category: "Tutorial", // Must match blogCategories
    featured: true, // Set to true for homepage feature
    author: { name: "Data Analyst" }
  }
]
```

**⚠️ Critical Requirements:**
- **Slug must be unique** - No duplicates allowed
- **Category must exist** - Only use: Learning, Analytics, Web3, Tutorial, AI
- **Date format exact** - "MMM DD, YYYY" (e.g., "Dec 15, 2024")
- **Commas matter** - Don't forget commas between objects

#### Step 3: Add Blog Content

Open `src/data/blog-content.ts` and add your full article:

```typescript
export const blogContent: { [key: string]: string } = {
  // ... existing content ...
  
  "building-first-defi-analytics-dashboard": `# Building My First DeFi Analytics Dashboard

Creating my first DeFi analytics dashboard was both challenging and rewarding. Here's my complete journey from concept to deployment.

## The Challenge

As someone transitioning from traditional finance to DeFi, I needed to understand protocol mechanics through data. Building a dashboard seemed like the perfect way to learn while creating something useful.

## Technology Stack

After researching various options, I settled on:

### Data Layer
- **Python** for data extraction and processing
- **PostgreSQL** for data storage
- **Web3.py** for blockchain interaction

### Visualization Layer  
- **Streamlit** for rapid prototyping
- **Plotly** for interactive charts
- **Pandas** for data manipulation

## Step 1: Data Architecture

First, I designed the data pipeline:

\`\`\`python
# Data extraction pipeline
import web3
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

class DeFiDataExtractor:
    def __init__(self, provider_url):
        self.w3 = web3.Web3(web3.HTTPProvider(provider_url))
    
    def get_protocol_data(self, protocol_address, start_block, end_block):
        # Extract transaction data
        transactions = []
        for block_num in range(start_block, end_block + 1):
            block = self.w3.eth.get_block(block_num, full_transactions=True)
            for tx in block.transactions:
                if tx.to == protocol_address:
                    transactions.append({
                        'hash': tx.hash.hex(),
                        'block': block_num,
                        'timestamp': block.timestamp,
                        'from': tx['from'],
                        'value': tx.value
                    })
        return pd.DataFrame(transactions)
\`\`\`

## Step 2: Key Metrics Implementation

I focused on essential DeFi metrics:

### Total Value Locked (TVL)
\`\`\`python
def calculate_tvl(df):
    return df.groupby('timestamp')['value'].sum().cumsum()
\`\`\`

### Daily Active Users
\`\`\`python
def daily_active_users(df):
    df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'], unit='s').dt.date
    return df.groupby('date')['from'].nunique()
\`\`\`

### Transaction Volume
\`\`\`python
def daily_volume(df):
    df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'], unit='s').dt.date
    return df.groupby('date')['value'].sum()
\`\`\`

## Step 3: Visualization Dashboard

Built an interactive dashboard with Streamlit:

\`\`\`python
import streamlit as st
import plotly.graph_objects as go

st.title("DeFi Protocol Analytics Dashboard")

# Sidebar controls
protocol = st.sidebar.selectbox("Select Protocol", ["Uniswap", "Compound", "Aave"])
date_range = st.sidebar.date_input("Date Range", value=[start_date, end_date])

# Main metrics
col1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)
with col1:
    st.metric("Total TVL", f"${tvl:,.2f}", delta=tvl_change)
with col2:
    st.metric("Daily Active Users", f"{dau:,}", delta=dau_change)
with col3:
    st.metric("24h Volume", f"${volume:,.2f}", delta=volume_change)

# Charts
fig = go.Figure()
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=dates, y=tvl_values, name="TVL"))
st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)
\`\`\`

## Challenges Faced

1. **Check browser console** - Look for JavaScript errors
2. **Run build command** - `npm run build` for TypeScript errors
3. **Compare with working examples** - Copy structure from existing content
4. **Simplify first** - Remove optional fields and add them back gradually
5. **Test in isolation** - Add minimal content first, then expand

**Useful commands:**
```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Check for build errors  
npm run lint         # Check code quality
git status           # See changed files
git diff             # See specific changes
```
