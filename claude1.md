# CLAUDE MASTER WARNING – DO NOT BREAK CODE OR LOGIC

⚠️ IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION ⚠️  
Every change, refactor, or implementation MUST follow these rules:  

1. **Do Not Break Anything**  
   - Never introduce breaking changes.  
   - Do not alter existing logic or features unless explicitly instructed.  
   - Ensure all existing functionality continues to work as before.  

2. **Backward Compatibility**  
   - If replacing a component, keep the same props, state management, and API calls.  
   - Make sure old code integrations still work seamlessly.  

3. **Testing & Validation**  
   - After making changes, simulate or check functionality to confirm nothing is broken.  
   - Run through key flows (navigation, forms, data fetch, admin dashboard).  

4. **Consistency**  
   - Follow existing coding patterns, structure, and naming conventions.  
   - Do not mix styles or introduce unapproved libraries.  

5. **Non-Destructive Updates**  
   - When unsure, create a new safe implementation and keep the old one until confirmed stable.  
   - Always prioritize **stability over speed**.  

✅ In summary: *Every update must preserve full functionality, logic, and performance of the site. No shortcuts, no silent breaks.*
