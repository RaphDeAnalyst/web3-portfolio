What You’re Doing Right

Clear Transition Narrative

The “Transitioning from Web2 to Web3 Analytics” tagline is strong and communicates your unique positioning immediately.

Personal Story Section

Nicely written — it explains your foundation (Python, SQL, finance analytics) and your shift into blockchain. This builds credibility.

Core Values Section

Transparency, Decentralization, Innovation → good alignment with Web3 culture. Shows you’re not just technical but also values-driven.

Technical Expertise Section

Splitting into 3 categories (Core Data Analytics, Web3 Analytics, Statistical Analysis & AI) is excellent for recruiters/hiring managers.

Shows both what you’ve mastered and what you’re learning.

Journey Timeline

Very clean and professional. Dates + milestones give a sense of progression and growth over time.

Call-to-Action at the End

“Ready to Build the Future?” with Start a Project / Download Resume buttons is excellent for engagement.

⚠️ Areas for Improvement

Story Depth

While clear, your story feels too general. You could enrich it with:

A specific project example where you applied Web2 skills to Web3 data.

Mention of platforms/tools you actively use (Dune, Flipside, Nansen, etc.).

Technical Expertise Levels

All are labeled “Expert” — which might look inflated since you also wrote “Web3 Analytics (Learning)”. Better to use tiered labels like: Proficient / Learning / Advanced.

Timeline Future Goals

Last milestone is “Career Transition Goal (2025)” → feels vague. Better to phrase it as a concrete target:

“Build advanced dashboards and publish insights in DeFi analytics”

“Secure a Web3 Data Analytics role or freelance projects”.

SEO & Keywords

Similar to the homepage, the About page could mention blockchain data analytics, DeFi, Dune Analytics, on-chain data, SQL, machine learning, predictive modeling → this helps with discoverability.

Download Resume CTA

Great that it’s there, but consider linking directly to a PDF resume (not a placeholder). Recruiters value instant access.

⭐ Rating (About Page)

Design & Structure: 90% (sections flow well, modern layout)

Overall: 79%

This is a strong About page — clean, professional, recruiter-friendly. With specific project examples, refined skill levels, and stronger future goals, it can hit the 90%+ range.

About page review

Rewritten “My Story”

I’m a data analyst transitioning from Web2 to Web3, with strong foundations in Python, SQL, and statistical modeling.

I began my analytics journey in 2022, building skills in data querying, visualization, and predictive analytics. By 2023, I had advanced into statistical modeling, regression, and machine learning applications, applying analytics to solve real-world problems.

In 2024, I became fascinated by blockchain’s open datasets and began studying DeFi protocols, smart contracts, and tokenomics. This curiosity prepared me for a full career pivot in 2025, when I started hands-on Web3 analytics projects.

Today, I work with Dune Analytics and Flipside Crypto to analyze wallet behavior, DeFi activity, and NFT markets, while also learning Solidity basics to deepen my understanding of blockchain data structures.

My goal is to establish myself as a Web3 Data & AI Specialist, bridging the rigor of traditional analytics with the transparency and innovation of blockchain data.

✍️ Rewritten “My Journey” Timeline

2022 – Entered Data Analytics
Began learning Python, SQL, and Excel; built first projects in traditional analytics.

2023 – Advanced Analytics Skills
Expanded into predictive modeling, regression, A/B testing, and visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, PowerBI).

2024 – Exploring Blockchain Concepts
Studied DeFi mechanics, tokenomics, and blockchain fundamentals; prepared for transition into on-chain data analytics.

2025 – Transition to Web3 Analytics
Started building Dune dashboards and Flipside queries to analyze wallet behaviors, DeFi protocols, and NFT markets. Actively creating a portfolio of case studies and dashboards.

✍️ Core Values (Polished Wording)

Transparency → Open-source methods with verifiable results

Decentralization → Empowering distributed systems and communities

Innovation → Turning complex blockchain data into actionable insights

👉 This new version positions you as:

Someone with a solid Web2 foundation

Already doing real Web3 work (dashboards, wallet analysis)

Actively upskilling with Solidity/DeFi

Clear about what you’re offering employers/clients in 2025
