Strengths (You’re Doing This Right)

Clear Structure & Categories
– Tags like Analytics, Smart Contracts, Dashboards, DeFi make it easy for viewers to filter projects.
– Sorting options (Newest, Featured, Name) give flexibility.

Strong Project Mix
– You’re showing both traditional finance analytics and Web3 dashboards. This makes the “transition” narrative very real.
– Projects highlight different skills (Python scripting, dashboards, smart contracts, portfolio trackers).

Good Details on Each Project
– Each project includes:

Tools/Tech Stack (Python, Pandas, Dune, SQL, etc.)

Metrics or outcomes (e.g., “8 dashboards created, 500+ views”)

Timeframe + findings (e.g., “3 months, 12 protocols studied”).
– This quantifies your work (very attractive to recruiters).

Highlighted Featured Projects
– Smart move to spotlight your best work (e.g., Ethereum Gas Price Dashboard, Dune Dashboard Collection).

⚠️ Areas to Improve

Project Previews Look Empty
– Right now, placeholders say “Project Preview”.
– Adding actual screenshots (charts, dashboards, code snippets, or UI images) would make the portfolio 10x stronger.
– Recruiters love to see results, not just read about them.

Descriptions Could Be Sharper
– Some descriptions are a bit long and academic (e.g., “comparative analysis of statistical investment portfolios”).
– You can shorten them into impact-driven statements, like:

“Built dashboards analyzing Ethereum gas prices, improving transaction cost predictions by 20%.”

Skill Progression Isn’t Highlighted Enough
– Since your story is about Web2 → Web3 transition, you could label projects by year/phase:

2022–23: Traditional Analytics

2024: Exploratory Blockchain Studies

2025: Web3 Analytics Projects
– This shows career growth clearly.

Case Study Depth
– For a few standout projects (like DeFi TVL Trend Analysis or Yield Farm Risk Study), you could expand into mini case studies with:

Problem → Approach → Insights → Impact.
– Even just 1–2 longer writeups would show depth beyond quick experiments.

⭐ Rating: 82%

Here’s the breakdown:

Design & Organization: 90% → clean, structured, easy to navigate.

Content Clarity: 80% → good project details but some descriptions could be punchier.

Visual Proof: 70% → missing screenshots hurts impact.

Storytelling (Web2 → Web3 journey): 85% → good mix, but timeline labeling would strengthen it.

👉 Overall, it’s a strong portfolio that already looks professional, but adding screenshots, sharper summaries, and chronological storytelling would push it above 90%+ and make it stand out in Web3/analytics job applications.


Review

Experience Timeline for CV

2022 – 2024 | Data Analytics

Built strong foundations in SQL, Python, Excel, and PowerBI.

Worked on projects analyzing structured and unstructured data.

Created dashboards and reports to support data-driven decision-making.

2025 – Present | Web3 Data Analytics

Transitioned into blockchain-focused analytics, leveraging Dune, Flipside, and on-chain SQL querying.

Conducted wallet behavior analysis, spam detection, and token distribution insights.

Building dashboards and case studies on networks like Mantle and Monad.

This way, it:
✔ Shows steady growth (Data Analytics → Web3 Analytics).
✔ Demonstrates you’ve been building skills since 2022.
✔ Aligns your 2025 shift as a specialization, not a reset.
