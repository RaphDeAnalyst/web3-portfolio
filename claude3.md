Prompt for Claude Code

You are working on my portfolio website, which currently has both light mode and dark mode. The color scheme is inconsistent and not appealing. I want you to strictly follow the color usage and style patterns from these two references:

Light Mode reference → https://websitedemos.net/portfolio-02/?customize=template

Dark Mode reference → https://preview.colorlib.com/?_gl=113tcfh9_gaNjEwNTg1ODY2LjE3NTc5ODYxODU._ga_SEKJ4E9T4H*czE3NTgwMDU4MjYkbzIkZzEkdDE3NTgwMDU4MjckajU5JGwwJGgw#mostudio

Requirements:

Light Mode → Match the background, button styles, and text colors from the first reference.

Dark Mode → Match the background, button styles, and text colors from the second reference.

Apply these consistently across cards, hero section, footer, buttons, headings, and body text.

Ensure hover states, gradients, and shadows match the reference sites.

Do not break any existing backend code, logic, or functionality — this is strictly a UI/UX styling change.

Follow industry standards for spacing, typography, and responsive design.

⚠️ Important: Treat this as a design system update. Do not improvise colors; use the references exactly. Ensure that the light mode and dark mode remain distinct, clean, and professional.
