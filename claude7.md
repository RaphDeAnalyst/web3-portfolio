Recommended Arrangement for You (Web3 Analytics Focus)

Since your personal brand is data + Web3, clarity and professionalism matter:

Home → short tagline like: “Web3 Data Analyst | Turning Blockchain Data into Insights”. Quick CTA: View My Work.

Portfolio → move this above About, because your work is your strongest selling point. People want to see what you can do first.

About → keep it simple, talk about your journey (Data Analytics → Web3 Analytics).

Services → optional, but if you want gigs, include what you can deliver (dashboards, reports, wallet analysis, on-chain insights).

Blog → optional, if you want to grow thought leadership.

Contact → last, but very visible (sticky button or footer).

✅ Key Change: Move Portfolio above About in your menu. Recruiters/clients will care about proof of skills more than your backstory.
